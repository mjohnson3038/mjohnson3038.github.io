        <p class="text">
          In college, I discovered my love for learning, problem solving, and logic. I entered college and being placed in Calculus I. However, by the time I graduated, I had completed a summer of math research, written an honors thesis, and discovered how cool math is. It is safe to say this is one of my proudest accomplishments. While looking for a job, I knew I wanted to solve similar problems, but each job required knowlege of programming. I began fiddling around with it online, and quickly realized how much I loved programming. In August 2016, I moved from Boston to Seattle to attend <a href="https://adadevelopersacademy.org/" class="link-in-text">Ada Developers Academy</a>, a year long, full time program to get more women and non-binary people into software development. Currently, I am interning with at the City of Seattle, with the <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/dpd/" class="link-in-text">Department of Contruction and Inspection</a>. I am building a public facing, visual, and interactive tool to help people learn about the permits required on their home improvement projects. I am currently looking for work as a fullstack software developer in Seattle.

          In my spare time, I enjoy learning to play frisbee (still a work in progress), completing giant jigsaw puzzles, eating ice cream and all thing with cheese, and watching documentaries.
